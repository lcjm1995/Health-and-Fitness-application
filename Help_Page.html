            <p>Do you want to reach a new fitness goal? Do you want to lose or gain weight? <br> <br>
                Use the LCJM fitness application to track and monitor your fitness and progress towards any goals <br><br>
                You can update your account at any time and create a new goal. This option is available in the My Account <br><br>
                View your progress in a graph on the My progress page and choose from a variety of graphical styles. <br><br>
                Based upon your gender, weight and height the application will calculate the amount of calories you should be consuming in the average day. Track this with your very own meal diary where you can add a new food (inc. their average portion calorie amount) or search for a variety of foods (and their nutritional information) from our database.</p>
